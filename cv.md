# About me
My passion for chemistry at school made everyone believe that I would attempt my career at medicine or science, but I decided to become a programmer. I have always been interested in creating eye-catching designs. But later I really wanted to know how to turn my design into a product.

About five years ago I got a free magazine about web-design. After getting some basic knowledge from this field I started to learn more by myself. Most of all I focused on working with Photoshop and CorelDraw. 

After graduating at school I went to university to become software engineer. I really like learning and creating new algorithms, solving problems that will burn out my brain, getting involved in interesting projects. 

I believe, that all my personal and professional skills will help me to become a professional Frontend Developer.

# Skills 

* Git, GitHub
* Photoshop, Figma, CorelDraw
* HTML5, CSS3
* C++, Javascript (Basics), Delphi

# Code example

**Bit counting KATA from Codewars:** *Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative.*

*Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function should return 5 in this case*

```
unsigned int countBits(unsigned long long n) {
  int ones = 0;
  while (n != 0) {
    if ((n % 2) == 1) {
      ones++;
    }
    n /= 2;
  }
  return ones;
}
```
